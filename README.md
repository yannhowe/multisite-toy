# multisite-toy
2 Django instances connected to different nodes in a MariaDB Galera cluster as a POC for multi-site application

## Quickstart
Sorry, data doesn't persist due to some quirks with the Galera setup.. but its just a toy!
```
git clone https://github.com/yannhowe/multisite-toy.git
docker-compose up --build && docker-compose down -v
```
